Please, feel free to contact me by email at <jomarm@jomarm.com>. I also accept
contributions by email; send me a git bundle or patches, and be sure to
indicate what project it's for. Since email contacts me directly, keep in mind
that other contributors may not be of your work until it's merged.

Though not a requirement, I would prefer that emails I receive be PGP signed
or encrypted. My public key is available via WKD or the URL
<https://jomarm.com/key.asc>. It should match the following fingerprint:

`F954 C5C9 5AE7 A312 183D  A76C 6AC4 6A6F 9A56 18D8`

If you do decide to use PGP, it would be great to inform me on where to find
your public key, or even just attach it to the email.
