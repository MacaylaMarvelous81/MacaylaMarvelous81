Certain repositories may also be available at
[git.jomarm.com](https://git.jomarm.com). Repositories may only be publicly
viewed there; it is not a source forge, and lacks certain functions that GitHub
has, such as issue trackers.

Always feel free to contact me by email at
[jomarm@jomarm.com](mailto:jomarm@jomarm.com). I also accept contributions by
email; send me a git bundles or patches, and be sure to indicate what project
it's for. Since email contacts me directly, keep in mind that other
contributors may not be privy to your work until it's merged; but it also
makes it simpler for me to keep track of.
