Please, feel free to contact me by email at <jomarm@jomarm.com>. I also accept
contributions by email; send me a git bundle or patches, and be sure to
indicate what project it's for. Since email contacts me directly, keep in mind
that other contributors may not be aware of your work until it's merged.

I will usually PGP sign my emails, and I will also encrypt them if I have the
necessary public key. My public key is available via WKD or the URL
<https://jomarm.com/key.asc>. It should match the following fingerprint:

`F954 C5C9 5AE7 A312 183D  A76C 6AC4 6A6F 9A56 18D8`

If you decide to use PGP, please remember to inform me on where to find
your public key, or even just attach it to the email.
